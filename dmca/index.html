<p>Your physical or electronic signature, or a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on your behalf;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit it to contact you or your authorized agent, including a name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address;
Identification of the Mark(s) alleged to have been infringed, including
for registered Marks, a copy of each relevant federal trademark registration certificate or
for common law or other Marks, evidence sufficient to establish your claimed rights in the Mark, including the nature of your use of the Mark, and the time period and geographic area in which the Mark has been used by you;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit our Designated Copyright Agent to identify the use being challenged;
A statement that you have not authorized the challenged use, and that you have a good-faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law; and

<p>A registered user may respond to notice of takedown by showing either (a) that the Mark has been cancelled, or has expired or lapsed or (b) that the registered user has a trademark registration, an unexpired license covering the use, or some other relevant right to the Mark, or (c) that the use is for other reasons shown by the registered user non-infringing. If the registered user makes an appropriate showing of either (a), (b) or (c) then our Designated Copyright Agent may exercise its discretion not to remove the Mark.</p>
<p>If our Designated Copyright Agent decides to comply with a takedown request, it will do so within a reasonably expeditious period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Designated Copyright Agent will comply as appropriate with the terms of any court order relating to alleged trademark infringement on the Service.</p>

Information reasonably sufficient to permit our Designated Copyright Agent to identify the use being challenged;
A statement that you have not authorized the challenged use, and that you have a good-faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law; and
A statement under penalty of perjury that all of the information in the notification is accurate and, that you are the IP owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of the IP owner.
Upon receipt of notice as described above, our Designated Copyright Agent will seek to confirm the existence of the IP on the Service, notify the registered user who posted the content including the IP, and take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including temporary or permanent removal of the IP from the Service.</p>
<p>A registered user may respond to notice of takedown by showing either (a) that the claimant does not own the IP or (b) that the IP is not infringed. If the registered user succeeds in showing either (a), (b) or (c) then our Designated Copyright Agent may exercise its discretion not to remove the IP.</p>
<p>If our Designated Copyright Agent decides to comply with a takedown request, it will do so within a reasonably expeditious period of time.</p>
<p>We Have No Obligation to Adjudicate IP Claims – User’s Agreement to Hold Us Harmless From Claims</p>
<p>Claimants and users must understand that we are not an intellectual property tribunal. While we and our Designated Copyright Agent may in our discretion use the information provided in order to decide how to respond to infringement claims, we are not responsible for determining the merits of such claims. If a user responds to a claim of infringement by providing assurances that its content is not infringing, the user agrees that if we thereafter restore or maintain the content, the user will defend and hold us harmless from any resulting claims of infringement brought against us and our Designated Copyright Agent.</p>
